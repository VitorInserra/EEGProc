"""The mathematical objective for one complete SIC counterfactual trial.

Only z_prime is optimized. The original trial x, original encoder features z,
and all model parameters are constants. Distances are means, not sums, so
their scale does not automatically grow with trial length or feature width.
There is no VAE, KL divergence, classifier training. physiological_validity is
a VCSC (volume-conduction spatial coherence) check, not a complete
physiological model. Electrode positions come from the real standard
10-10/10-05 system (see the module-level constants below). All four
calibration curves are MEASURED from 414 real DREAMER trials and shipped in
vcsc_calibration_dreamer.npz; earlier literature-derived versions (Nunez et
al. 1997 for c_hat, Bendat & Piersol for sigma_raw, w_hat = 0 from Vinck et
al. 2011's debiased estimator) were checked against real EEG and rejected it
outright, so they were replaced. See _vcsc_calibration_curves for why, and
for the caveats that come with an empirical calibration.

Measured discrimination on the calibration set: real trials score below white
noise 88% of the time (median 0.66 vs 12.1), so this separates plausible from
implausible input but is not a clean decision rule -- about 12% of real trials
score worse than noise. Treat it as one graded axis among several, per the
report, not as a standalone accept/reject test.

    These are MEASURED from real data, not derived from formulas. They are the
    per-pair, per-band mean and standard deviation of magnitude-squared
    coherence and debiased wPLI^2 across all 414 real DREAMER trials, computed
    through the same preprocessing the model sees (1 s windows, no overlap,
    128 Hz, global_rms normalization, theta/alpha/beta band-pass).

    Why measured rather than derived. Earlier versions used Nunez et al.'s
    volume-conduction formula for c_hat, the Bendat & Piersol sampling-variance
    result for sigma_raw, and w_hat = 0 on the grounds that Vinck et al.'s
    debiased wPLI^2 is unbiased under the null. Checked against real EEG, that
    combination rejects everything: real trials score a median VCSC of 8.6e7,
    worse than white noise. Two reasons, both instructive:

      * w_hat = 0 is right for UNCORRELATED sources, but real brains have
        genuine phase-lagged coupling. Real debiased wPLI^2 is 0.061, not 0,
        so a normal trial sat ~11 sigma out on the wPLI axis alone.
      * The Bendat & Piersol sigma is the SAMPLING std -- uncertainty in
        estimating one trial's coherence. What the z-score needs is the
        ACROSS-TRIAL std, which also contains real biological variability
        between trials and is roughly 6x larger (0.216 vs 0.035).

    The tradeoff this buys. Calibrating to real data drops separation between
    plausible and implausible input from the ~1e5 the old formulas suggested to
    roughly 16x. That is the honest number: the large separation existed only
    because the calibration was tight enough to reject real EEG too.

    Caveats. Measured at n_windows=60 on DREAMER valence trials; n_windows is
    accepted for signature compatibility and to warn on mismatch, but the
    curves are not rescaled by it, since across-trial biological variance --
    which does not shrink with window count -- dominates the sampling term.
    Calibration is pooled across valence, which the data supports (low 0.262
    vs high 0.278 mean coherence). Applying these to another dataset, montage,
    or preprocessing chain requires regenerating the file.
